## Renovation Calculator (RenoCalc)
Purpose â€“ to create a costed Packing Slip reflecting the materials needed to renovate a bedroom

### Topics of Evaluation
1.	Obtaining and displaying information
2.	Sequential processing
3.	Numerical calculations
4.	Decision making
5.	Create a working maintainable programming solution using topics 1-4 above, to create the Renovation Calculator program using programming techniques demonstrated in class.

### Requirements
1.	Create a model for the program by uploading a flowchart or writing the pseudo code in the header comment block for the program. 
2.	Create a test plan and proof of output (screenshot uploaded for test case).
3.	Upload the code after implementing your model (commit often to GitHub).
4.	Test your code with your test plan. If you discover mistakes, correct the code and model, and execute the test plan again.
